# HelloWord
Pushing Jenkins Jobs  To Github
This is essentially a simple executable program written in java to output the phrase "Hello World" ten times....
However the major goal was to push the file to my github repository... Now the lines of action are enumerated below....
[1] I created the executable file called Hello.java n stored in a directory, in this case a local repository
[2] The directory including the file was initialized with the init command
[3] Two files Hello.class and Hello.java where added to this local repository using the < git add . > command
[4]  On my github account, I started a project named "HelloWorld" and the HTTPS link copied and used on the CLI to add
the HTTPS link using the <git add remote origin > commands
[5] Push the two files into my guthub repository < git push -u origin master>
